The contributors approach the topic from the perspectives of three different countries—Canada, Switzerland, and Australia—to overcome objections that a universal program to keep all citizens above the poverty line would be too expensive to implement. They assess the complex array of revenue sources that can make universal basic income feasible, from the underestimated value of public program redundancies to new and so far unaccounted publicly owned assets.},

  abstract = {From entrepreneur Andrew Yang, the founder of Venture for America, an eye-opening look at how new technologies are erasing millions of jobs before our eyes--and a rallying cry for the urgent steps America must take, including Universal Basic Income, to stabilize our economy. "The shift toward automation is about to create a tsunami of unemployment. Not in the distant future--now. One recent estimate predicts 13 million American workers will lose their jobs within the next seven years--jobs that won't be replaced. In a future marked by restlessness and chronic unemployment, what will happen to American society? In [this book], Andrew Yang paints a dire portrait of the American economy. Artificial intelligence, robotics, and automation software are making millions of Americans' livelihoods irrelevant. The consequences are already being felt across our communities in the form of political unrest, drug use and other social ills. Meanwhile, our institutions and leaders seem unable to meaningfully respond and adapt to the new realities. The future looks bleak---but is it unavoidable? Yang imagines a different future--one in which work and money are not inextricably linked. At this vision's core is universal basic income, the concept of providing all citizens with a guaranteed income--one that is rapidly gaining popularity among forward-thinking politicians and economists. Yang proposes that UBI is an essential step toward a new, more durable kind of economy, which he calls Human Capitalism. The War on Normal People is a groundbreaking book about how Americans can build a sustainable economy and healthy society amid the rapid technological change of the twenty-first century."--Dust jacket.},

  abstract = {Today the United States has one of the highest poverty rates among the world's rich industrial democracies. The Failed Welfare Revolution shows us that things might have turned out differently. During the 1960s and 1970s, policymakers in three presidential administrations tried to replace the nation's existing welfare system with a revolutionary program to guarantee Americans basic economic security. Surprisingly from today's vantage point, guaranteed income plans received broad bipartisan support in the 1960s. One proposal, President Nixon's Family Assistance Plan, nearly passed into law in the 1970s, and President Carter advanced a similar bill a few years later. The failure of these proposals marked the federal government's last direct effort to alleviate poverty among the least advantaged and, ironically, sowed the seeds of conservative welfare reform strategies under President Reagan and beyond. This episode has largely vanished from America's collective memory. Here, Brian Steensland tells the whole story for the first time--from why such an unlikely policy idea first developed to the factors that sealed its fate. His account, based on extensive original research in presidential archives, draws on mainstream social science perspectives that emphasize the influence of powerful stakeholder groups and policymaking institutions. But Steensland also shows that some of the most potent obstacles to guaranteed income plans were cultural. Most centrally, by challenging Americans' longstanding distinction between the "deserving" and "undeserving" poor, the plans threatened the nation's cultural, political, and economic status quo.},

  abstract = {Berkeley Electronic Press Selected Works, This article shows how the cost of Universal Basic Income (UBI) is often misunderstood and greatly exaggerated. It then presents simple, “back-of-the-envelope” estimates of the net cost of a UBI set at about the official poverty line: \$12,000 per adult and \$6,000 per child with a 50\% “marginal tax rate.” These back-of-the-envelope calculations present a greatly simplified UBI scheme meant not a practical proposal but as a method to obtain a ballpark estimate of the cost of UBI in isolation. Even with simplifying assumptions, these figures are several times more accurate than many common but exaggerated estimates. Key findings of this study include the following. The net cost—the real cost—of this UBI scheme is \$539 billion per year: about one-sixth its often-mentioned but not-very-meaningful gross cost of about \$3.415 trillion. The net cost of this UBI scheme is less than 25\% of the cost of current U.S. entitlement spending, less than 15\% of overall federal spending, and about 2.95\% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The average net beneficiary is a family of about two people making about \$27,000 per year in market income. The family’s net benefit from the UBI would be nearly \$9,000, raising their income to almost \$36,000.},

  abstract = {The War on Poverty is the unofficial name for legislation first introduced by United States President Lyndon B. Johnson during his State of the Union address on Wednesday, January 8, 1964. This legislation was proposed by Johnson in response to a national poverty rate of around nineteen percent.  The speech led the United States Congress to pass the Economic Opportunity Act, which established the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO) to administer the local application of federal funds targeted against poverty.
As a part of the Great Society, Johnson believed in expanding the federal government's roles in education and health care as poverty reduction strategies.  These policies can also be seen as a continuation of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal, which ran from 1933 to 1937, and the Four Freedoms of 1941. Johnson stated, "Our aim is not only to relieve the symptom of poverty, but to cure it and, above all, to prevent it".The legacy of the War on Poverty policy initiative remains in the continued existence of such federal programs as Head Start, Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA), TRiO, and Job Corps.
Deregulation, growing criticism of the welfare state, and an ideological shift to reducing federal aid to impoverished people in the 1980s and 1990s culminated in the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act of 1996, which President Bill Clinton claimed, "ended welfare as we know it."},

Second, it uses routinely collected health administration data and a quasi-experimental design to document an 8.5 percent reduction in the hospitalization rate for participants relative to controls, particularly for accidents and injuries and mental health. We also found that participant contacts with physicians declined, especially for mental health, and that more adolescents continued into grade 12. We found no increase in fertility, family dissolution rates, or improved birth out­ comes. We conclude that a relatively modest GAI can improve population health, suggesting significant health system savings.},

The distinction has important consequences for output and employment multipliers. The paper also extends the IE model to incorporate a government job guarantee program (JGP), and the extended model illuminates the automatic stabilizer properties of a JGP. The model is then extended to include Kaleckian income distribution effects. That generates a novel Kaleckian balanced budget multiplier driven by changed composition of government spending. The paper concludes with some economic and political economy concerns about a JGP that are flagged by the model.},

  abstract = {The idea that states should provide a means-tested guaranteed minimum income for citizens who are unable to meet their basic needs is widely shared and has been a central component in the evolution of social citizenship rights in existing welfare states. However, an increasing number of activists and scholars defend the more radical option of establishing a universal basic income, that is, an unconditional income paid to all members of society on an individual basis without any means test or work requirement. Indeed, some political philosophers have argued that basic income is one of the most important reforms in the development of a just and democratic society, comparable to other milestones in the history of citizenship rights, such as universal suffrage or even the abolishment of slavery. Basic income or similar ideas, such as a basic capital or a negative income tax, have been advanced in many versions since the 18th century in different parts of the world and under a great variety of names. However, while these were previously often isolated and disconnected initiatives, basic income has more recently become the object of an increasingly cumulative research effort to shed light on the many aspects of this idea. It has also inspired policy developments and given rise to experiments and pilot projects in several countries.},

@article{chrispPOLITICALECONOMYBASIC,
  langid = {english},
  title = {{{THE POLITICAL ECONOMY OF BASIC INCOME}}},
  abstract = {The last few years have seen an exponential rise in interest in basic income. To date, most analysis has taken either a normative (e.g. Van Parijs \& Vanderboght 2017) or a descriptive (Torry 2016) perspective. There have been comparatively few attempts to try to understand the political economy of basic income and to identify potential political constituencies. An obvious approach to exploring the potential sources of support for basic income is to examine the determinants of welfare state attitudes and preferences. Existing research has identified a variety of labour market risks as significant predictors of welfare state preferences, whether redistribution (Cusack, Iversen, \& Rehm, 2006), social spending (Soskice \& Iversen, 2001), job creation or the contributory benefit principle (Häusermann, Kurer, \& Schwander, 2015). There is also a common narrative about basic income that it is a response to growing labour market risks and that it is a policy for the precariat (Standing, 2011). However, existing research does not sufficiently indicate whether those at risk would support a basic income. Using European Values Study data from 2008, this paper tests the significance of labour market risk in predicting two previously unexplored preferences related to basic income attitudes to unemployment benefit conditionality and the importance of work. These indicators are shown alongside redistribution and government responsibility preferences to illustrate the multi-dimensional nature of potential basic income support.},

To envision this, we first have to stop asking ourselves how this could be financed. We also have to assume that there will be no adjustment reactions – price responses, tax evasion or mass immigration – that could shatter this dream.},
